## Supported hardware
The driver currently supports the following Raspberry Pi models:
- Zero
- Zero W
- 1 Model A
- 1 Model A+
- 1 Model B
- 1 Model B+
- 2 Model B
- 3 Model A+
- 3 Model B
- 3 Model B+
- Compute Module 1
- Compute Module 3
- Compute Module 3 lite
- Compute Module 3+
- Compute Module 3+ lite
