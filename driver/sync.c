 * Semaphores are a synchronization primitive that can be used to insert a dependency between batches submitted to queues.
 * Semaphores have two states - signaled and unsignaled. The state of a semaphore can be signaled after execution of a batch of commands is completed.
 * A batch can wait for a semaphore to become signaled before it begins execution, and the semaphore is also unsignaled before the batch begins execution.
 * As with most objects in Vulkan, semaphores are an interface to internal data which is typically opaque to applications.
 * This internal data is referred to as a semaphoreâ€™s payload. However, in order to enable communication with agents outside of the current device,
 * it is necessary to be able to export that payload to a commonly understood format, and subsequently import from that format as well.
 * The internal data of a semaphore may include a reference to any resources and pending work associated with signal or unsignal operations performed on that semaphore object.
 * Mechanisms to import and export that internal data to and from semaphores are provided below.
 * These mechanisms indirectly enable applications to share semaphore state between two or more semaphores and other synchronization primitives across process and API boundaries.
 * When created, the semaphore is in the unsignaled state.

 * vkCmdPipelineBarrier is a synchronization command that inserts a dependency between commands submitted to the same queue, or between commands in the same subpass.
 * When vkCmdPipelineBarrier is submitted to a queue, it defines a memory dependency between commands that were submitted before it, and those submitted after it.
 * If vkCmdPipelineBarrier was recorded outside a render pass instance, the first synchronization scope includes all commands that occur earlier in submission order.
 * If vkCmdPipelineBarrier was recorded inside a render pass instance, the first synchronization scope includes only commands that occur earlier in submission order within the same subpass.
 * In either case, the first synchronization scope is limited to operations on the pipeline stages determined by the source stage mask specified by srcStageMask.
 *
 * If vkCmdPipelineBarrier was recorded outside a render pass instance, the second synchronization scope includes all commands that occur later in submission order.
 * If vkCmdPipelineBarrier was recorded inside a render pass instance, the second synchronization scope includes only commands that occur later in submission order within the same subpass.
 * In either case, the second synchronization scope is limited to operations on the pipeline stages determined by the destination stage mask specified by dstStageMask.
 *
 * The first access scope is limited to access in the pipeline stages determined by the source stage mask specified by srcStageMask.
 * Within that, the first access scope only includes the first access scopes defined by elements of the pMemoryBarriers,
 * pBufferMemoryBarriers and pImageMemoryBarriers arrays, which each define a set of memory barriers. If no memory barriers are specified,
 * then the first access scope includes no accesses.
 *
 * The second access scope is limited to access in the pipeline stages determined by the destination stage mask specified by dstStageMask.
 * Within that, the second access scope only includes the second access scopes defined by elements of the pMemoryBarriers, pBufferMemoryBarriers and pImageMemoryBarriers arrays,
 * which each define a set of memory barriers. If no memory barriers are specified, then the second access scope includes no accesses.
 *
 * If dependencyFlags includes VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT, then any dependency between framebuffer-space pipeline stages is framebuffer-local - otherwise it is framebuffer-global.
